      `I designed <strong>SympleSynth</strong> to explore my interest in audio synthesis and to practice developing for the Web with no frontend frameworks. The instrument manages its own state and coordinates complex sound modulations using the JavaScript event loop.
      I took advantage of OOP principles to make my code more modular and re-usable. Each component of the synthesizer is contained in its own object, with public methods exposed to allow users to control the sound. The different oscillators, filters, and effects make it possible to create millions of different sounds!`,

          music, and the ability to play, browse, and share music with other users. It was a single-page app that used AJAX requests to display updated data without reloading.`,
